        <h2>Boxe Fran√ßaise</h2>
        <p>
           I am passionated about ballet and street-dancing since I was a child. In high school, I wanted to start a new sport in which I would spend more energy. It's by accompanying my brother to a boxing session that I understood that this sport was ideal. French boxing combines agility, strength and balance.

     <h2>Fashion</h2>
        <p>
         "La mode passe, le style jamais." Coco Chanel
         Throughout history, fashion has always been a part of our lives. Once a social marker, today fashion is a daily means of artistic expression.

      <h2>Theater</h2>
        <p>
            When I was a child, I was very shy and had trouble expressing myself in public. Then I discovered theatre with my teacher. We had an improvisation class every Friday afternoon. 
            When I started acting, I gained self-confidence and got to know myself better. Acting became a passion for me. 
            Working on a piece of theater is very formative, it requires to learn a text but also to appropriate it. Working on someone's role requires investment and empathy. Personally, when I play I have to become my character. 
            We must always listen to each other and be careful not to fall into the pure recitation of text. Otherwise the character stops living.
            Finally, theatre allows us to understand human behaviour and relationships.
